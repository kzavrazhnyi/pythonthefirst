Data generation & creatings tables

I want you to act as a data generator. Can you write SQL queries in PostgreSQL 14 that
create a table "customers" with the columns "customer_id", "username", "email",
"join_date", "last_purchase_date". Include relevant constraints and index.

Common table expressions

I want you to act as a SQL code programmer. | am running PostgreSQL 14. Can you rewrite
this query using CTE?

SELECT DISTINCT Customer.Custld
, Customer.Name
, Customer.EMailAddr
FROM Customer
WHERE
EMailAddr IN (
SELECT EmailAddr
FROM Customer
WHERE EMailAddr ILIKE '%GMAIL%' OR EMailAddr ILIKE '%YAHOO%'
GROUP BY EmailAddr
HAVING COUNT(*)>1}
)

Write SQL queries from natural language

I want you to act as a data scientist. | have three PostgreSQL 14 tables "customers" for an
e-commerce company. The customers table consists of the columns "customer_id",
"customer_name", "customer_email", "customer_phone", and "customer_address". Using
"“customer_email", can you count the number of customers who use gmail, outlook, yahoo,
or other providers?

I want you to act as a data scientist. | have PostgreSQL 14 tables "sales" for an e-
commerce company. The sales table consists of the columns "customer_id",
"product_id", "sale_date", "sale_quantity". Can you please write a query that finds the 7-
day running average of sale_quantity?
